<h1>Stack </h1>

The file contains an implementation of a stack data structure using arrays in C++.
It includes solutions to specific problems involving stack manipulation.
One solution provided is for reversing the elements of the stack.
Another solution is for reversing the order of words within a string, effectively transforming it into a formally structured language.
The stack reversal algorithm utilizes auxiliary stacks.
The string manipulation algorithm employs string tokenization and stack-based reversal techniques.
These implementations aim to offer efficient solutions to common stack-related problems encountered in computer science and programming contexts.
